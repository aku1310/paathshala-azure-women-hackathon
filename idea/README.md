### Inspiration
Women in rural areas do not have access to the information they require to grow their knowledge and become more educated. It is due to this lack of information, many women do not get a chance to prove themselves in the field they wish to excel in.

### Idea 
The idea is to make education more accessible to rural women by developing a web service to bridge the gap between education and poverty. This chatbot feature will enable women in rural backgrounds to access educational materials in different cross-cultural languages by automatic translation and autosuggestion to ensure an upward learning graph. A special audio feature is provided in this application for audio listeners and auditory learners.

This application aims to be the one stop solution to prepare young girls to become successful women irrespective of their financial backgrounds, by achieving mastery in all necessary life skills.

The learning material is accessed from reliable resources like Rashtriya Madhyamik Shiksha Abhiyan (RMSA), Beti Bachao Beti Padhao(BBBP) and Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE), is provided according to previous application history of the study materials accessed by the user. Meanwhile, ensuring a holistic approach to female students growth with various subjects like personal finance, physics, moral science, history, environmental studies, economics, emotional intelligence and many more. 

### Future Aspect
We wish to develop an offline version for the same to provide the opportunity of basic education to everyone.
