## Frontend
Currently we have used HTML and CSS to show how the web application would look and some of the features that will be available to the user. The user will have the option of selecting their language to use the application and get the required material.

## Backend
We are used Python which includes Azure Cognitive Speech Services for the translation of text available to the language selected by the user.
